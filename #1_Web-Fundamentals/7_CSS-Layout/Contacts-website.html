                            -In a world so mechanised comes the need for robot builders, but making robots is not that easy as it looks when you were a kid.If you wanna give robotics a try this is where you can prepare yourself or optionally run screaming.

                            -When you're making robots for customers usually(99.23%) they don't want their "toasters" look like toasters.This is the course where you learn to design beautiful "toasters", optionally human like.
                            <span class="subject">Mechanics basics</span>
                            -Someone said that robots making robots is perverse. So you have to learn to make robots from scratch or go home.This is the course where you learn how to not get killed when you get a hammer or touch a wire and ofc build a robot (the working ones are preferred).
                            <span class="subject">Robot structure basics</span>
                            -Building robots without knowing their structure is like cooking meals nobody will eat.So start learning robot structure. Then maybe at end of the course you'll know which is the head and which the leg and maybe what makes robots "alive".

                            -Their came the day when we realised "bucket heads" are really stupid and talking with them is similar to talking with someone from the planet Painer, we created artificial intelligence. If you want bright future in robotics this course is the next step in your education.
                            <span class="subject">Robot control systems</span>
                            The robot control systems course will teach you how to make the software needed to manage and control the “toasters” you call robots. If you have expectations that your  so-called “robot” will be precise as a surgeon, you are completely wrong… At the end you will be happy if the movements of your so-called robot are even slightly similar to the movements of a zombie with Parkinson’s disease.
                            <span class="subject">Maintenance</span>
                            In this course is important for you to learn, how to properly maintain the scraps you’ve build. It’s important for us to teach you that when you couldn’t recognize the color of your machine under the rust, and when the agony of the machine is so big, that it wants to commit suicide, then it’s maybe time to drive him in the pit.

                            Nanotechnologies sounds very smart and complicated right? Well, it just sounds so… Actually your job will be to learn how to make the zinc oxide for all types of cosmetic products. After all you got to have plan B, in case you are no good at building robots!
                           <span class="subject"> Energy supply</span>
                            You’re not you when you’re hungry? So does robots, but a random guy who by chance gives you snickers won’t do the job. That’s why we are going to show you how to give your robots some ”nuts”!
                            <span class="subject">Bio-mechanical robotics</span>
                            Biomechanics is the study of the structure and function of biological systems such as humans, animals, plants, organs, and cells by means of the methods of mechanics. In this course we’ll explore two of the most physically active species on the planet (the sloth and the programmer) to learn how they put their bodies to the limit and beyond! After the course you’ll have the knowledge how to build the ultimate physical structure for your robots.
